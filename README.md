# ML_in_Finance
This is the group project of group 2 for the Seminar Introduction to Machine Learning (03SMBOEC0385). Our group used Google Colab to simplify collaboration. To load the data we used !git clone to clone the repository with the data on Google Colab. In case you want to run the jupyter notebook on your own device instead, you can also download the data from this repository and change the filepath in pd.read_csv() to the filepath of the data.
